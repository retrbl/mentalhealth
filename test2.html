<h2> Major Depressive Disorder </h2>
<h3>Question- Why is depression more prevalent in women than in men?</h3>
<h4 class = "paragraph"><p>Answer- Biological, life cycle, hormonal and psychological factors that are unique to women is possibly linked to the higher depression rate among women. Research has shown that hormones affecting brain brain chemistry has an impact on emotions and mood. Prior to adolescence among girls and boys, both genders experience depression at the same frequency. However, by adolescence, girls become more likely to experience depression compared to boys. Research has shown that two factors that contribute to a higher depression rate among women during their adolescence  are biological and hormonal changes that occur during puberty. In addition, compared to men, research has shown that women are more likely to feel bad about a situation even after it happened, suggesting that they are more prone to depression </p></h4>

<h3>Question- What about adults who experience depression later in life?</h3>
<h4 class = "paragraph"><p>Answer- For adults who experience depression later in life, other factors such as changes in the brain or body, may play a part. For instance, older adults may experience a restricted blood flow. Over time the blood vessels become less flexible and may even harden and prevent blood from flowing normally to the body’s organs. If this does occur in someone who has no family history of depression, doctors may refer to it as vascular depression. Individuals who are at risk of vascular depression may also be prone to suffering from cardiovascular illnesses such as heart disease or stroke.</p></h4>

<h3>Question- What is the difference between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa?</h3>
<h4 class = "paragraph"><p>Answer- The main difference between these two types of eating disorders is that anorexia nervosa is a syndrome of self starvation where the individual loses 15 percent or more of ideal body weight compared to patients suffering from bulimia nervosa who are at normal weight or even above.Those who suffer from bulimia are known to have a cycle of dieting, binge-eating and over the top behavior in order to prevent weight gain.

<h2> Bipolar Disorder </h2>
<h3>Question- What are the risks of bipolar disorder?</h3>
<h4 class = "paragraph"><p>Answer- People who suffer from bipolar disorder are more prone to deal with substance abuse since many people use drugs and alcohol to self mediate. In addition, people experiencing manic episodes are also at a higher risk of participating in activities that could endanger their welfare. Those who suffer from bipolar disorder are also at a higher risk of suicide so it’s very important that you comfort and encourage your loved ones to call a hotline if they’re suffering from bipolar disorder.</p></h4>

<h3>Question- What is the difference between bipolar disorder and depression?</h3>
<h4 class = "paragraph"><p>Answer- The main difference between bipolar disorder and depression is the appearance of manic episodes. Due to this, depression alone can not justify whether or not a person suffers from bipolar disorder. However, one manic episode is sufficient enough to make a bipolar disorder.</p></h4>
