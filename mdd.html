            <p>While there is no single founder of the discovery of depression there are early accounts of Depression which could be seen as early as the second millennium in Mesopotamia. Such accounts were discovered in early writings which discussed depression as spiritual condition rather than a physical condition. Depression was once thought to be caused by demonic possession. At the time depression was often dealt with by priests rather than physicians. As time went on doctors such as Rhazes, a Persian doctor, saw mental illnesses as a phenomenon that arises from the brain. Rhazes recommended some treatments such as baths and early forms of behavior therapy which promoted positive recompenses for exhibiting appropriate behavior. Nevertheless, during the middle ages several doctors sought after the physical causes of depression yet most doctors believed that depression was considered a spiritual attack. In the 17th century, a doctor named Robert Burton published a book titled “Anatomy of Melancholy” which discussed the idea that depression was caused by factors such as poverty, fear and loneliness. Burton advised those who suffered from depression to diet, exercise, travel, clear toxins from the body, intake herbs, have music therapy and practice bloodletting. During the Age of Enlightenment depression was viewed as an incurable weakness which was inherited from birth. During the second half of the Age of Enlightenment, doctors suggested that patients who suffered from depression should talk to family,friends and doctors as a way of treating their mental illness.</p>

            <p>Throughout the years, there has been a pattern in those who suffer from Major Depressive Disorder. Some of the main causes of depression are physical, emotional or sexual abuse which could increase the vulnerability to clinical depression in an individual’s latter years. Sometimes the effects of experiencing abuse could happen in as little as a few months or could even take years to appear. Another cause of depression is certain medications. Medications such as  isotretinoin and corticosteroids could actually increase an individual’s chances of suffering from depression. In addition, a death or loss of a loved one may also increase an individual’s likelihood of suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. Genetics could also play a part in someone’s chances of suffering from depression. For example, an individual who has a family history that suffered from depression would be more likely to suffer from depression as well. Other factors that contribute to someone suffering from depression are substance abuse, major life altering events and serious illnesses.</p>
