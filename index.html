        <h2 class = "body1">Our Mission</h2>
        <h4 class = "welcome">Originally started as an idea for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program’s final project,
          which occurs 2 weeks before the end of the program, we wanted to do something impactful for our
          community using our new acquired coding skills over the past 5 weeks. We not only wanted a resource for teenagers our own age,
          or just informing others about these mental illnesses, but rather for everyone who experiences difficulties with their own mental health,
          or loved ones seeking advice to help someone in their own life who is dealing with mental health issues.
          Thus, we started our initiative called <b>Girls Who Raise Awareness</b>, a website that can link
          others to learn more about these conditions, but also de-stigmatize the whole image behind “mental illnesses”.
          The most common image painted by society when referring to individuals who have mental illnesses is that they have “problems”,
          or names of illnesses are just thrown around casually, with many individuals not thinking about the meaning behind these conditions.
          Our team wants to be able to change that, to tell others that mental health is extremely important and holds a lot of meaning,
          and that everyone is completely valid.
          Welcome to Girls Who Raise Awareness, and we hope that you’ll enjoy your stay!></h4>
