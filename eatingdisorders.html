      <h3 class = "text2">History</h3>
      <h4 class = "text4"><p>People practicing eating little to no food as a personal choice can be traced all the way back to the 12th and 13th centuries. During this time period, women practiced self-starvation as a religious practice. Saint Catherine of Seina was one of the most well known women who practiced self-starvation. Saint Catherine of Seina alongside a number of women would starve themselves for weeks or eat very little portions of food for months at a time They believed that this method of fasting was a way to prove their devotion to God. A few centuries later in 1689, English physician Richard Morton described symptoms of anorexia in a condition he referred to as “wasting disease”. In 1873 Sir William Gull stated that both male and females suffered from anorexia. During this time period there was a shift in self starvation being practiced for religious traditions to fields of medicine and psychiatry. There seemed to have been a shift from spiritual perfection to body-image perfection during this time period.</p></h4>

      <h3 class = "text2">Causes</h3>
      <h4 class = "text4"><p>Contrary to popular belief, eating disorders does not suddenly happen because of one’s obsession with their body image. In fact, there are several factors that could contribute to an individual’s eating disorder. One factor could be due to genetics. In fact, individuals who are born with certain genotypes are at a higher risk of developing an eating disorder throughout their lifetime. Another factor that contributes to the development of an eating disorder are personality traits. These personality traits are often thought to be heritable and could be seen even before the individual has developed an eating disorder. Such personality traits includes overthinking, perfectionism, harm avoidance, impulsivity and excessive persistence. Another factor that could contribute to the development of an eating disorder is experiencing a traumatic event. For instance, physical or sexual abuse could precipitate the development of an eating disorder. Survivors of traumatic events often struggle with shame, guilt, body dissatisfaction and a feeling of a lack of control.  The eating disorder may become the individual’s attempt to regain control or cope with the intense emotions boiling inside of them. As expected, sociocultural ideals also play a part in the development of an eating disorder among individuals. As many strive to fit into the beauty norms of this world some may take extreme lengths to fit that standard.</p></h4>
