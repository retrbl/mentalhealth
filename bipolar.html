      <h3 class = "text2">History</h3>
      <h4 class = "text4"><p>Just like any other mental illness we have discussed earlier, bipolar disorder also has ancient beginnings. Aretaeus of Cappadocia began the process of detailing symptoms in the medical field as early as the 1st century. He made several notes on the link between mania and depression. The ancient Greeks and Romans were both responsible for the terms “mania” and “melancholia” which are now referred to as “manic” and “depressive”. They were even the ones who discovered that lithium salts could be used in baths to calm manic people and ease their spirits. Lithium is used to treat those who suffer from bipolar disorder even up today. In the 17th century, Robert Burton wrote the book “The Anatomy of Melancholy,” which discussed the issue of treating melancholy using music and dance. In the latter part of the 17th century, Theophilus Bonet published “Sepuchretum” in which he linked mania and melancholy in a condition called  manico-melancholicus. This was a major advancement in diagnosing bipolar disorder since mania and depression were considered separate disorders.</p></h4>

      <h3 class = "text2">Causes</h3>
      <h4 class = "text4"><p>Before we get started, we need to be aware of the two phases or moods that individuals who suffer from bipolar disorder go through. The first phase is known as mania or hypomania. These two terminologies refer to a “high” mood. Meanwhile the second phase of bipolar disorder is known as the depressive state. Just like any other mental illness, bipolar disorder doesn’t have a single cause. Instead, there are several factors that contribute to the development of bipolar disorder. For instance, some studies have suggested that there may be a genetic component to having a bipolar disorder. Someone who has a family history with bipolar disorder would be more likely to develop signs of this condition. In most cases, patients who suffer from bipolar disorder often have brain-chemical imbalances and hormonal problems. Even environmental factors such as abuse, a significant loss and a traumatic event could all pose as risk of developing bipolar disorder.</p></h4>
