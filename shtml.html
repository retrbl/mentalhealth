      <h4 class "text4"><p>Eugene Bleuler was the first person to coin “Schizophrenia” as a term derived from the Greek words “schizo” which means split and “phren” which means mind. However, Emil Kraepelin was the first one to distinguish Schizophrenia from other forms of psychosis. For example, he was able to differentiate bipolar disorder and depression from Schizophrenia. Since there wasn’t that much of an understanding of Schizophrenia, Kraepelin did have some mistaken beliefs about the nature of Schizophrenia. Although Kraepelin first isolated Schizophrenia from other mental illness, signs of the discovery of Schizophrenia came centuries before his time. The oldest available description of an illness that resembled Schizophrenia can be found in the Ebers papyrus which dates back to Egypt, 1550 BC. Schizophrenia was seen as a mental illness as early as the days of Greek mythology. During this time period mental illness was seen as a punishment from God. As time went on, an early scientist named Hippocrates thought that mental illnesses such as Schizophrenia, resulted in an imbalance  of the four humors (yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm). Hippocrates believe that people who suffered from mental illnesses could be treated with the practice of methods including bloodletting, special diets and purgatives. As time went on, several scientists like the ones previously mentioned has developed treatments that would be a safer alternative to patients who suffered from Schizophrenia.</p></h4>

      <h3 class = "text2">Causes</h3>
      <h4 class = "text4"><p>The exact causes of Schizophrenia are still unknown to this day. However, research does show that a combination of physical, genetic, psychological and environmental factors can all make an individual more likely to develop this condition. To begin with, there have been patterns that suggests that Schizophrenia tends to run in families. However, no single gene is thought to be responsible for the development of Schizophrenia. It’s more likely that a combination of several genes would make a person more vulnerable to the development of Schizophrenia. Studies have also shown that those who do suffer from Schizophrenia has subtle differences in the brain compared to those who don’t suffer from Schizophrenia. Research has also shown that people who do develop Schizophrenia experienced complications before or during pregnancy, such as low birth weight, premature labor and lack of oxygen during birth. There are also some factors that could trigger the development of Schizophrenia in an individual such as drug use, emotional or physical abuse, losing job or home and going through a divorce.</p></h4>
